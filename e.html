    <h1 class="history">History of St. Anthony's High School, Sakinaka</h1>
    <p>At St. Anthony's we had a humble beginning with Junior K.G. in 1974 with 34 students on roll with our school motto being
        'Knowledge dispels darkness.' A small chapel was the landmark of the school. It was a symbol of simplicity, sacrifice and hard work with its stretching arms,  and welcoming embrace, an epitome of giving that others may receive. At St. Anthony's, it was a nucleus
        that sprouted not merely to the darkness but to enrich and enlighten the people of Sakinaka. <br> <br>
        Fr. Misquitta, the Parish Priest of St. Judes, Jerimeri was the priest in charge of Sakinaka who used to come and oversee the work here. <br> <br>
        The pioneer work of educating the people of Sakinaka was entrusted to Sr. Annie Tauro (1974-78) of St. Catherine's Convent, Juhu belonging to Dominican sisters, who was appointed to be in charge of this humble institution in the year 1974. As a founder staff, she was a teacher, a catechist and a social worker knocking at the doors to enrol the children in the school. She not 
        only laid the solid base for this great Institution of today but was also an inspiration to many. <br> <br>
        The school was officially registered on 1st July, 1975 under the able guidance of the founder Manager & Trustee - Fr. Agnel Castelle (1974-1978). In the initial stages,
        the founder members had to persuade the parents to enroll their children in the school. <br> <br>
        In the interest of progress, the old chapel was replaced by a modern structure. The uphill task of raising the school building was undertaken by Fr. Agnel and the founder members of the 
        school and was completed due to the hard work, sacrifice and cooperation of the people of Sakinaka. <br> <br>
        It was during the time of Fr. Vincent Monteiro (1978-84) as Manager, the building was extended and divisions were increased. The school was registered under the Secondary School Certificate of Maharashtra Board.
        He along with the Principal Sr. Jessie Pinto (1978-83) were responsible for raising the school 
        to its heights.</p>
